# Real-time Traffic Simulation System using SUMO and Java
This project integrates the SUMO Traffic Simulator with a Java application (Eclipse IDE) using the TraCI protocol via the TraaS Java library.
The goal is to allow real-time simulation control from a Java GUI, visualize vehicle flows, and support basic traffic management operations.

## Project Overview
This project is a simple **real-time traffic simulation** written in Java.  
It simulates:
- Vehicles moving on a predefined road network  
- Traffic lights switching between red/yellow/green states
- Roads and map layout 
- A GUI built using Java Swing (similar to SUMO-GUI)  
- Real-time behavior controlled by a Swing `Timer`

## Installation
- JavaSE-11
- SUMO-gui
- Eclipse IDE
---

## Features
- Object-oriented design with multiple classes  
- Traffic lights change using timers 
- Road network rendering (horizontal + vertical)  
- Smooth animations  
- Modular structure split across multiple classes  
- Easy to extend with new features
- Real-time animated environment
- GUI similar in concept to SUMO-GUI
- Configurable update frequency
- Clean, modular Java project structure
