# Real-time Traffic Simulation System using SUMO and Java
This project integrates the SUMO Traffic Simulator with a Java application (Eclipse IDE) using the TraCI protocol via the TraaS Java library.
The goal is to allow real-time simulation control from a Java GUI, visualize vehicle flows, and support basic traffic management operations.
